JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. 
It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 95% of websites using it for this purpose.
Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. 
All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.
